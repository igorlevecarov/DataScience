    "<h1>Credit Card Routing for Online Purchase via Predictive Modelling</h1>\n",

    "<h1>1. Introduction</h1>\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Online retail business\" implies a business process in which customers have a plethora of options in searching for, selecting, and purchasing products, information, and services over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most retailers sell their goods online, and this explains why online retail business is simply a form of electronic commerce that enables consumers to buy goods or services or shop directly from their phones, tabs, laptops, or other internet-connected devices anywhere in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>1.1 Methodology</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the case study the cross-industry standard process for data mining or CRISP-DM will be used. The process icludes 6 phases (steps) which include further generic tasks: \n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Business Understanding</li>\n",
    "<li>Data Understanding</li>\n",
    "<li>Data Preparation</li>\n",
    "<li>Modeling</li>\n",
    "<li>Evaluation</li>\n",
    "<li>Deployment</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "The generic tasks describe what needs to be done in a phase before moving on to the next one. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2>1.2 Business Understanding</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past decade, more and more payment options have become available for customers to make online payments, making them more convenient than ever. Due to this trend, any business can benefit massively from offering multiple payment options to its customers. This helps in acquiring new customers, as well as retaining current ones. However, maintaining a growing number of payment options can create a lot of extra costs, labor, and security issues. This is where Payment Service Providers (PSPs) can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "PSPs (also called Merchant Service Providers) are third-party companies that help business owners accept a wide range of online payment methods, like online banking, credit cards, debit cards, e-wallets, cash cards, and more. Basically, they make sure your transactions make it from point A to point B, safely and securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "PSPs see to it that transactions are completed — from the start, when a customer enters their details and initiates a payment, to finish, when you receive it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>1.2.1 Problem definition</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, businesses face more and more pressure to reduce costs, reduce process times and increase profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Online credit card payments are performed via so-called payment service providers, referred to as “PSPs”. The current routing logic is manual and rule-based. The company has contracts with four different PSPs and pays transaction fees for every single payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past year the Online retail have encountered a high failure rate of online credit card payments. The company loses a lot of money due to failed transactions and customers become increasingly unsatisfied with the online shop. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>1.2.2 Main Goal And Specific Objective</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Business decision-makers, however, hope that with predictive modelling and with your help, a smarter way of routing a PSP to a transaction is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Analyze the problem root cause. How success rate is changing over time?\n",
    "2. Build a model that increase the payment success rate by finding the best possible PSP for each transaction and at the same time keep the transaction fees low.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>1.2.3 Tools</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools used for the project are: Jupiter Notebook, Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn."
